# Canine-Cooked-Food-Nutrition-Analytics
This project analyses cooked dog‑food products available in the UK, focusing on their nutritional composition, ingredient quality, and brand‑level differences. It demonstrates how raw nutrition data can be transformed into clean, reliable, analytics‑ready datasets using Python, SQL, and analytics engineering best practices.

The project is designed to mirror a modern analytics workflow (similar to dbt-style modelling), including:

- Data ingestion and cleaning

- Data quality checks

- SQL data modelling

- Derived nutrition metrics

- Brand‑level insights

- Documentation and reproducibility

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

1. Macro distribution
